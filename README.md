## ‚úèÔ∏è Customization

This portfolio is designed to be easily customized.

### 1. Personal Information (`index.html`)

All personal details (name, "About Me" text, skills, contact info) can be edited directly in the HTML of the `index.html` file.

### 2. Adding Projects (`projects.html`)

Adding new projects is simple, thanks to the JavaScript array at the bottom of `projects.html`.

1.  Open `projects.html` and scroll down to the `<script>` tag.
2.  Find the `allProjects` array.
3.  Copy an existing project block (from `{` to `},`) and paste it into the array.
4.  Update the details: `category`, `image`, `title`, `description`, `tech`, `liveLink`, and `sourceLink`.

**Example:**

```javascript
const allProjects = [
    // ... existing projects
    
    // To add a new project, copy this block:
    {
        category: 'web', // or 'game'
        image: 'https://your-new-project-image-url.com/image.png',
        title: 'My New Awesome App',
        description: 'A description of this fantastic new project.',
        tech: ['Tech1', 'Tech2'],
        liveLink: '#',
        sourceLink: '#'
    }
];
