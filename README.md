## Features

-   **3D Animated Hero:** The homepage greets visitors with a dynamic 3D animation powered by Three.js.
-   **Scroll-Based Animations:** Content gracefully fades in on the main page as the user scrolls, and the hero text transitions through my different roles.
-   **Dedicated Projects Page:** A main landing page (`index.html`) provides a quick overview, while a separate `projects.html` page showcases my entire body of work.
-   **JavaScript-Powered Grid:** The projects page is generated dynamically from a simple JavaScript array, automatically sorting projects into "Web Development" and "Game Development" categories.
-   **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized to ensure a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
